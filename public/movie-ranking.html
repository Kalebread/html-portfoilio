<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>Directed and written by Greta Gerwig, one of my all time favourite film maker, she once again created the movie that's going into the history books. 
    This movie is not all rainbows sunshine and unicorns, it sinks into a deeper level. 
    Feminism, patriarchy, equility, all in this movie.
    It was honestly one of the best live action movies I've watched.

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>"Now I am become death, destroyer of the world."<br />
    OKAY, first of all, wow. 
    Oppenheimer is definitely the movie that drained out 1/4 the things I learned in physics and history.
    All the studying of quantum physics and WW2 is so worth it.
    Oppenheimer is THE man, the man that stands between heaven and hell, the man that got crushed between fame and morality.
    He is our world today.

<h3>Spiderman: Across The Verse</h3>
<p>I've never watch a single spider man movie but THIS, THIS animation is something.
    The whole concept of going to different verses in conjunction with the different art styles is literally genius.
    So many amazing and talented artist were involved and it's really cool to see the art style range.
    From colour pop to lego, it's like watching an indie film more than a big cooperation film.
    The story line is quite well but personally I'm more fond of the characters and soundtrack.
